# Contribution

Thank you for considering helping out with the source code! We welcome contributions from anyone on the internet, and are grateful for even the smallest of fixes!

If you'd like to contribute to NoF, please fork, fix, commit and send a pull request for the maintainers to review and merge into the main code base. If you wish to submit more complex changes though, please check up with the [core devs](https://github.com/P4-Games/NoF-LandingPage/graphs/contributors) first to ensure those changes are in line with the general philosophy of the project and/or get some early feedback which can make both your efforts much lighter as well as our review and merge procedures quick and simple.

Please make sure your contributions adhere to our coding guidelines:

# Coding guidelines

## Commit changes

The application uses a linter for commit messages, requiring them to be specified in the following format:

```
- [type] message
- [type] :icono: message
```

Example:

```
- commit -m [chore] add commitlinter
- commit -m [chore] :sparkles: add commitlinter (to commit with an icon, you can use [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/))
```

The allowed standard types are:

```
- feat: A new feature for the user.
- fix: Fixes a bug that affects the user.
- perf: Changes that improve site performance.
- build: Changes in the build system, deployment tasks, or installation.
- ci: Changes in continuous integration.
- docs: Changes in documentation.
- refactor: Code refactoring such as variable or function name changes.
- style: Changes in formatting, tabs, spaces, or semicolons, etc.; do not affect the user.
- test: Adds tests or refactors an existing one.
- chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files.
- revert: Reverts a previous commit.
```

Failing to comply with these standards will cause the pre-commit to fail. To remove the last commit (without losing changes), run:

```sh
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

For more information, refer to: [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/).
